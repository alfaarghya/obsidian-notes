## **Why Docker**

Docker and containers have gained significant popularity and importance for several reasons:

1. **Kubernetes/Container Orchestration**:
	Docker containers are the building blocks of modern container orchestration platforms like Kubernetes. Kubernetes is designed to manage and orchestrate containerized applications at scale, making it easier to deploy, scale, and manage applications across multiple hosts or clusters. Docker provides a consistent and standardized way to package applications and their dependencies into containers, enabling seamless integration with Kubernetes and other orchestration tools.
2. **Running Processes in Isolated Environments**:
	Docker containers provide an isolated and self-contained environment for running processes. Each container has its own file system, network stack, and resource allocation, ensuring that applications running within containers are isolated from one another and from the host system. This isolation helps in achieving better security, resource management, and portability for applications.
3. **Starting Projects/Auxiliary Services Locally**:
	Docker simplifies the process of setting up and running development environments locally. Developers can easily spin up containers for their applications, as well as any auxiliary services (such as databases, caching servers, or message queues) required for their projects. This streamlines the development workflow, ensuring consistent environments across different development machines and reducing the "works on my machine" issues.
4. **Consistent Deployment Across Environments**:
	Docker containers encapsulate an application and its dependencies, ensuring that the application runs consistently across different environments (development, testing, staging, and production). This consistency eliminates the common issues caused by differences in operating systems, dependencies, or configurations, making it easier to deploy and manage applications in various environments.
5. **Efficient Resource Utilization**:
	Docker containers are lightweight and share the host operating system's kernel, resulting in efficient resource utilization compared to traditional virtual machines. This allows for higher density of applications running on the same hardware, leading to better resource utilization and
