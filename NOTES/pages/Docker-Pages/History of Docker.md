Docker was founded in 2008 as a platform-as-a-service (PaaS) company called dotCloud by Solomon Hykes, Kamel Founadi, and Sebastien Pahl in Paris, France. The company later incorporated in the United States in 2010 and participated in the Y Combinator accelerator program during the summer batch of 2010.

Initially, dotCloud focused on providing a PaaS solution for developers to build and deploy applications. However, during the development process, the team realized the potential of the underlying container technology they were using, which later became known as Docker.

Docker's vision was to make containers mainstream and enable developers to easily deploy their applications using containers. This vision has largely become a reality today, as many projects on GitHub now include Dockerfiles, which are files used to create Docker containers for packaging and deploying applications.

Today, Docker is a leading player in the container ecosystem, providing tools and services for building, shipping, and running containerized applications. Its impact on the software development and deployment landscape has been significant, paving the way for the adoption of microservices architectures, cloud-native applications, and modern DevOps practices.
